### Presentation

^ Up until this point everything we've focused on has been related to content, and structure. This has been intentional, because without content we have no project. Without structure we have no way of presenting our content. These concepts are critical and must be addressed before we can work on presenting our content. You know enough of the fundamentals to now begin working on content, structure and presentation.

### CSS Syntax

```css
/*********************************
* Description: Primary style sheet
* Author:      Phil Sinatra
*********************************/
body {
  background-color: #facd8a;
}
/* Adjust the styles for headings */
h1 { color: #3636363; }
h2 {
  font-style: italic;
  border-bottom: 2px solid #fff; /* Add line below h2 */
}
```

---

### Rule Sets

```css
/* selector */
h1 {

}
```

^ A CSS file consists of _rule sets_. A rule set consists of a _selector_ followed by a set of braces.

---

### Rule sets

```css
/* selector */
h1 {
  /* property: value */
  color: navy; /* declaration */
}
```

^ Within the braces are one ore more _declarations_, and each declaration consists of a _property_ and a _value_. Note that the property is followed by a colon and the value is followed by a semicolon.

^ The selector in this example is `h1` so the rules apply to all `h1` elements. Then, the rule set consists of a single property named color that is set to the color navy. The result is that the content of all h1 elements will be displayed in navy blue.

---

```css
h2 {
  border-bottom: 2px solid #fff;
  font-style: italic;
}

ul {
  list-style-type: square;
}
```

^ Here are some other rule sets. Rule sets can include a single or multiple declarations.

---

```css
h2 {
  border-bottom: 2px solid #fff; /* Add lines below h2 headings */
  font-style: italic;
}

ul {
  list-style-type: square; /* Change bullets to squares */
}
```

^ You can also code comments that describe or explain what the CSS code is doing. For each comment you start with `/*` and end with `*/`, and everything between those characters is ignored. You can also use comments to comment out portions of code that you want disabled, which is useful when you're testing your CSS code just like when you're testing your HTML code.

## How to code basic selectors

---

```html
<body>
  <h1 class="base_color">Student materials</h1>
  <p>Here are the downloads:</p>
  <ul id="links">
    <li><a href="exercises.html">Exercises</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p id="copyright" class="base_color">&copy; 2016</p>
</body>
```

---

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 100%;
  padding: 1em;
  width: 300px;
}
h1 { font-size: 180%; }
```

^ The selector of a rule set identifies the HTML element or elements that the rules should be applied to. This example shows how to use three of the most basic selectors for CSS rule sets.

^ The first type of selector identifies HTML elements like `body`, `h1` or `p`. The selectors in this example apply to the body and h1 elements. These selectors are called _type selectors_.

---

```html
<body>
  <h1 class="base_color">Student materials</h1>
  <p>Here are the downloads:</p>
  <ul id="links">
    <li><a href="exercises.html">Exercises</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p id="copyright" class="base_color">&copy; 2016</p>
</body>
```

---

```css
#copyright {
  font-size: 75%;
  text-align: right;
}
```

^ The second type selector starts with a pound sign (#) and applies to the single HTML element that's identified by the `id` attribute. In this example `#copyright` applies to the HTML element that has an `id` attribute with the value of _copyright_.

---

```html
<body>
  <h1 class="base_color">Student materials</h1>
  <p>Here are the downloads:</p>
  <ul id="links">
    <li><a href="exercises.html">Exercises</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p id="copyright" class="base_color">&copy; 2016</p>
</body>
```

---

```css
.base_color {
  color: blue;
}
```

^ The third type of selector starts with a period (.) and applies to all of the HTML elements that are identified by the `class` attribute with the named value. In this example `.base_color` applies to all the elements with `class` attributes that have a value of *base_color*. This includes the `h1` element and the last `p` element.

---

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 100%;
  padding: 1em;
  width: 300px;
}

h1 { font-size: 180%; }

#copyright {
  font-size: 75%;
  text-align: right;
}

.base_color { color: blue; }
```

^ To code a selector for an HTML element, you simply name the element. This is referred to as a _type selector_.

^ If an element is coded with an `id` attribute, you can code a selector for that id by coding a pound sign followed by the id value, as in `#copyright`.

^ If an element is coded with a `class` attribute, you can code a selector for that class by coding a period followed by the class name, as in `.base_color`.

---

## Provide styles

^ Before you code the CSS for a web page, you need to know how to provide the CSS file for a web page. There are three ways to provide CSS styles for a web page.

---

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="/css/master.css"
  media="screen"
  title="master styles"
  charset="utf-8">
```

^ First, you can code a link element that refers to an _external style sheet_. That's a separate file that contains the CSS for the page. This separates the content from the formatting and makes it easy to use the same sytles for more than one page.

^ The attributes for a link element that links to an external file are the `rel` (relationship) attribute with a value of "stylesheet", and the `href` attribute which locates the file. There are additional attributes that can be applied such as `media`, `title`, `charset` etc.

---

```html
<head>
  <style>
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  }
  h1 {
    font-size: 130%;
  }
  </style>
```

^ Second, you can embed a CSS style sheet in the HTML for a page. This is referred to as an _embedded style sheet_. When you embed a style sheet, the CSS rule sets are coded in a style element in the head section of the HTML.

---

```html
<h1 style="font-size: 250%; color: red;">
  Town Hall
</h1>
```

^ Third, you can use _inline styles_ within an HTML document. When you use an inline style, you code a style attribute for the HTML element with a value that contains all the CSS rules that apply to the element. This type of formatting means the content and formatting are tightly linked and can quickly get out of control.

---

## _Cascading_ Style Sheet

^ The term _Cascading Style Sheet_ refers to the face that more than one style sheet can be applied to a single web page. If two or more rules for the same property are applied to the same element, the cascade order and other rules determine which rule takes precedence.

---

![fit](http://i.giphy.com/13XW2MJE0XCoM0.gif)

^ This is sometimes a difficult concept to master, and can be the cause of a lot of headaches, especially if your code is not well organized. If you find yourself repeating the same code multiple times in your stylesheet, you need to optimize your approach. If you make changes to a property in your stylesheet and are not seeing those changes reflected in the browser, you have to organize your code better.

---

### The cascade order

- `!important` rules in a user style sheet
- `!important` rules in a web page
- normal rules in a web page
- normal rules in a user style sheet
- default rules in the web browser

---

```css
.highlight {
  font-weight: bold !important;
}
```

^ How to identify a rule as important.

---

### Multiple rules at same cascade level

```css
.highlight { /* rules here */ }

/* More specific selector */
p.highlight { /* rules here */ }
```

^ The rule with the highest specificity is used.

---

```css
p.highlight { color: red; }
p.highlight { color: blue; }
/* .highlight text will be blue */
```

^ If the specificity is the same, the rule set specified last is used.

---

### Determining selector specificity

- **id** is the _most_ specific
- **class** or **pseudo-class** is _less_ specific
- **element** or **pseudo-element** is _least_ specific

---

## Measurements

    Symbol  Name    Type      Description

    px      pixels    absolute  a single dot on a monitor
    pt      points    absolute  1/72 of an inch
    em      ems       relative  1em = current font size
    %       percent   relative  relative to current size
    vw      viewport  width     relative relative to viewport
    vh      viewport  height    relative relative to viewport

^ You use the units of measure to specify a variety of CSS properties, including font-size, line-height, width, height, margin and padding. These are the four units of measure that are commonly used with CSS: pixels, points, ems and percent. The first two are absolute units, the second two are relative units.

^ When you use relative units of measure like ems or percent, the measurement will change if the user changes the browser's font size. Example: You set the size of a font to 80 percent of the browser's default font size, that element will change if the user changes the font size in the browser. Because this lets the users adjust the font sizes to their own preferences, it is often recommended to use relative measurements for font sizes.

---

## Measurements

    Symbol  Name    Type      Description

    px      pixels    absolute  a single dot on a monitor
    pt      points    absolute  1/72 of an inch
    em      ems       relative  1em = current font size
    %       percent   relative  relative to current size
    vw      viewport  width     relative relative to viewport
    vh      viewport  height    relative relative to viewport

^ When you use absolute units of measurement the measurement won't change even if the user changes the font size in the browser. Example: set the width of an element in pixels and the font size in points, the width and font size won't change.

^ When you use pixels though, the size will change if the screen resolution changes. Screen resolution determines the number of pixels that are displayed on the monitor. Pixels on a monitor with a screen resolution of 1280 x 1024 are closer together than the pixels on a monitor with a screen resolution of 1152 x 864. That means a measurement of 10 pixels will be smaller on the screen with the higher resolution. A point is 1/72 of an inch no matter what the screen resolution is.

---

```css
body {
  font-size: 100%;
  margin-left: 2em;
  margin-right: 2em;
}

header {
  padding-bottom: .75em;
  border-bottom: 3px solid black;
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 200%;
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```

---

## Color

^ There are a number of ways to specify color. We will look at the most common three.

---

[CSS3 Color spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color)

```css
p {
  color: silver;
}
```

[Color Names](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp)

^ The easiest way is to specify a color name.

---

```css
p {
  color: rgb(100%, 40%, 20%);
  color: rgb(255, 102, 51);
}
```

^ Another way to specify a color is to use an _RGB_ value. One way to do that is to specify the percent of red, green and blue that make up the color. You can also use any values from 0 through 255 instead of percents (0 is equivalent to 0% and 255 is equivalent to 100%, this gives you more precision over the resulting colors).

---

```css
p {
  color: #ffffff; /* white */
  color: #000000; /* black */
  color: #ff0000; /* red */
}
```

^ The third way to specify a color is to use the _hexadecimal_ values for red, green and blue. When you use this technique the value must be preceded by the pound sign (#).

---

## Specifying color

```css
body {
  background-color: #ffffcc; /* light yellow */
  color: black;
}

p {
  background-color: #ff0000; /* red */
  /* color will be inherited as `black` */
}
```

^ The `color` property determines the foreground color (the color of the text). The `background-color` property determines the background color.

^ The `color` property for an element is _inherited_ by any child elements. For example: if you set the `color` for the `body` to _black_, that color will be inherited by all of the elements in the body of the document. However, you can override an inherited property by coding a rule set with a different value for that property.

---

### Accessibility guideline

^ Remember the visually-impaired. Dark text on a light background is easier to read, and black type on a white background is easiest to read.

---

## CSS3

```css
rgba(red%, green%, blue%, opacity-value)

hsl(hue-degrees, saturation%, lightness%)

hsla(hue-degrees, saturation%, lightness%, opacity-value)
```

^ To provide even more color options, CSS3 lets you code color specifications in three more ways. First, you can use _RGBA values_. This works like RGB values, but with a fourth parameter that provides an opacity value. Set the value to 0, the color is fully transparent, set the value to 1 and the color is fully opaque. The other two methods focus on hue, saturation and lightness.

---

## Coding selectors

```html
<main>
  <h1>Main Heading</h1>
  <p class="blue">Hello world!</p>
  <p class="blue">What's up?</p>
</main>
<footer>
  <p id="copyright" class="blue right">&copy; 2016</p>
</footer>
```

^ Once you understand how to code selectors, you will be able to apply CSS formatting to any element in a web page.

---

```css
/* All elements */
* {
  margin: .5em 1em;
}
```

^ The first rule set uses the _universal selector_ so it applies to all HTML elements. You won't necessarily need to use the universal selector often, but it is available if needed.

---

```css
/* Elements by type */
main {
  border: 2px solid black;
  padding: 1em; }
h1 { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }
p { margin-left: 3em; }
```

^ The next group of rules select elements by type. These are known as _type selectors_. To code a type selector you just code the name of the element. (explain rules applying to all `h1`, `p` elements etc.)

---

```html
<main>
  <h1>Main Heading</h1>
  <p class="blue">Hello world!</p>
  <p class="blue">What's up?</p>
</main>
<footer>
  <p id="copyright" class="blue right">&copy; 2016</p>
</footer>
```

^ Let's take a look at our HTML again. Note the element with the `id` attribute.

---

```css
/* One element by ID */
#copyright {
  font-size: 80%;
}
```

^ The next selector selects an element by its id. To do that, the selector is a pound sign (#) followed by an id value that uniquely identifies an element. As a result, this rule set selects the `p` element that has an id of _copyright_, and then applies the rules to that element.

---

```html
<main>
  <h1>Main Heading</h1>
  <p class="blue">Hello world!</p>
  <p class="blue">What's up?</p>
</main>
<footer>
  <p id="copyright" class="blue right">&copy; 2016</p>
</footer>
```

^ One more time let's review the HTML

---

```css
.blue { color: blue; }
.right { text-align: right; }
```

^ The two rule sets in this group select HTML elements by class. To do that, the selector is a period (.) followed by the class name. As a result, the first rule set selects all elements that have been assigned to the "blue" class. The second rule set selects any elements that have been assigned to the "right" class.

^ One of the key points here is that a class attribute can have the same value for more than one element on a page. If you code a selector for that class, it will be used to format all the elements in that class. Since the id for an element must be unique, an id selector can only be used to format a single element.

---

## Relational selectors

^ As we discuss relational selectors, keep in mind that terms like _parent_, _child_, _sibling_, and _descendent_ are used in the same way that they are in a family tree. Child elements are at the first level below a parent. Sibling elements are at the same level. Descendent elements can be one or more levels below a parent element.

---

```html
<main>
  <h1>Heading One</h1>
  <ul class="speakers">
    <li>Jan: <a href="#">David B.</a></li>
    <li>Feb: <a href="#">Robert F.</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Heading Two</h2>
  <p>Welcome all speakers.</p>
  <p>A limited number of tickets remain.</p>
</main>
```

^ That means a _descendant selector_ selects all the elements that are contained within another element. For instance, all of the elements in the HTML example are descendants of the `main` element. The `li` elements are also descendants of the `ul` element. The `a` elements are descendants of the `li` elements.

---

```css
/* Descendant */
main li { font-size: 90%; }
ul a { color: green; }
```

^ To code a descendant selector, you code a selector for the parent element, followed by a space and a selector for the descendant element. The first selector selects all the `li` elements within the `main` element. The second selects all the `a` elements that are descendants of the `ul` element.

---

```html
<main>
  <h1>Heading One</h1>
  <ul class="speakers">
    <li>Jan: <a href="#">David B.</a></li>
    <li>Feb: <a href="#">Robert F.</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Heading Two</h2>
  <p>Welcome all speakers.</p>
  <p>A limited number of tickets remain.</p>
</main>
```

^ The next example shows how to use an _adjacent sibling selector_ to select an element that's coded at the same level as another element and is also coded right next to it. For instance, the `h1`, `h2` and `p` elements in the HTML are all siblings, and the `h1` and `ul` elements are adjacent siblings. In contrast, the `h1` element and the `p` elements aren't adjacent siblings, but the `h2` element and the first `p` element are adjacent siblings.

---

```css
/* Adjacent sibling */
h2+p { margin-top: .5rem; }
```

^ To code an adjacent sibling selector, you code a selector for the first element, followed by a plus sign and a selector for the sibling element. This example will select an `p` elements that are adjacent to `h2` elements.

---

```css
/* Child */
main>p { font-size: 80%; }
li>a { color: green; }
```

^ If you want to select elements only when they're child elements of a parent element, you can code a _child selector_. To do that, separate the parent and the child selector with a greater than sign (>). The first child selector selects the `p` elements that are children of the main element, and the second selector selects the `a` elements that are children of the `li` elements.

^ NOTE: Think of what the words "child" and "descendant" mean.
^ - My daughter is both my child and my descendant
^ - My granddaughter is not my child, but she is my descendant

---

```css
p ~ span { color: red; }
```

```html
<span>This is not red.</span>
<p>Here is a paragraph.</p>
<code>Here is some code.</code>
<!-- This span shows red. -->
<span>And here is a span.</span>
```

^ Unlike the adjacent sibling selector, a _general sibling selector_ selects any sibling element whether or not the elements are adjacent. To code this type of selector, you separate the selector for the first element and the selector for the sibling element by a tilde (~). This example selects all the `span` elements that follow a `p` element. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_selectors)

---

## Combination selectors

---

```css
/* Selector for a class within an element */
ul.speakers { list-style-type: square; }
```

^ To select an element type by class name, you code the element name, followed by a period and the class name. This example selects `ul` elements that have a class of "speakers".

---

```css
/* Multiple selectors*/
h1, h2, h3 { color: blue; }

p, ul.speakers li {
  font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;
}
```

^ You can also code multiple selectors for the same rule set. To do that, you separate the selectors with commas.

---

## Pseudo-class / Pseudo-element Selectors

---

### Common CSS pseudo-classes

    :link     A link that hasn't been visited.
    :visited  A link that has been visited.
    :active   The active link (mouse button down)
    :hover    An element with mouse hovering
    :focus    An element that has focus (forms)

^ These classes represent conditions that apply to the elements on a page. You can use the `:link` pseudo-class to refer to a link that hasn't been visited, the `:hover` pseudo-class to refer to the element that has the mouse hovering over it.

---

### Common CSS3 pseudo-classes

    :first-child  The first child of an element
    :last-child   The last child of an element
    :only-child   The only child of an element

^ You can also use CSS3 pseudo-classes to refer to specific relationships.

---

### Common CSS3 pseudo-elements

    ::first-letter  The first letter of an element.
    ::first-line    The first line of an element.

^ You can use CSS3 pseudo-elements to select portions of text.

---

```html
<main>
  <p>Welcome to Town Hall.</p>
  <p>We have great speakers.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Jeff T.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Andrew S.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Amy C.</a></li>
  </ul>
</main>
```

---

```css
a:link { color: green; }
a:hover, a:focus { color: pink; }

main p:first-child { font-weight: bold; }
main p:first-child::first-letter { font-size: 150%; }
```
---

## Browser Default Styles

^ A problem web developers face today when it comes to CSS is that the five modern browsers render some elements of a web page differently. Let's look at some examples.

---

![fit](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/uploads/default/original/3X/e/4/e4e871f08fbd8bf66e2da5742587ddd40292f148.png)

![inline](http://digm.drexel.edu/crs/IDM221/presentations/images/normalize_homepage.png)

[Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css)

^ To standardize how elements like this are displayed, you can use the _normalize.css_ style sheet. This can save you a lot of time dealing with small rendering issues near the end of a project.

^ The normalize style sheet also sets the margins for the body of the document to zero. That means there's no space between the body and the edge of the browser window. This is important because different browsers provide different margins for the body. It also defaults the font family to sans-serif, which we'll learn more about later. For reasons like these, many web developers use the normalize style sheet for all their projects.

---

### How to

[github.com/normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)

^ Save a copy of the normalize.css file to your website and then code a link to the file in the `head` of each html page. Note: this link should be before the link to your personal style sheet(s).
